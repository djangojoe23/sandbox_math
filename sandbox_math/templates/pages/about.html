                    August, 2023 - Sandbox Math is designed for anyone who wants to get better at algebra, specifically when it comes to solving equations to find unknown values. You should already know some basic math concepts like adding, subtracting, using parentheses, and working with letters that stand for unknown numbers. But if you're finding it a bit tricky to solve equations and figure out those unknown values, Sandbox Math is the best place to practice until it becomes easy for you.
                    <br><br>
                    However, if you're already really good at math and you're not making any mistakes here, then Sandbox Math might not be the right fit for you. If that's the case, congrats, you're very smart. You should be doing something more challenging! Plus, no one likes a show-off.

                    August, 2023 - Right now, Sandbox Math focuses solely on tackling linear equations to find the value of a variable. You can also work on solving equations where one variable is expressed in terms of another. It's worth noting that these types of problems involve a lot of "sneaky math" such as basic arithmetic, using inverse operations, order of operations, substituting values, and evaluating algebraic expressions. And of course, improving your perseverance, analytical thinking, and problem-solving abilities is an integral part of the process!
                    <br><br>
                    Looking ahead, we have a plan to introduce a wider range of math Sandboxes. Our ideas include expanding the algebra Sandbox to cover non-linear equations, inequalities, and systems of two equations two unknowns. Additionally, we're considering launching a pre-algebra Sandbox, where you can practice simplifying algebraic expressions. Further down the line, we're envisioning introducing a graphing Sandbox and a geometry Sandbox to provide even more diverse opportunities for students to engage in meaningful practice.

                    What people really need is a place where they can meaningfully practice what's been explained to them and use the skills they've seen in examples. That's where Sandbox Math comes in.
                    <br><br>
                    Algebra is the most failed high school course, even though it's necessary for getting a high school diploma. What's more concerning is that algebra is not too hard for anyone to get the hang of. We are all smart enough to do algebra. So, then what's the issue? Teachers and online videos explain the concepts clearly, and there are countless example problems available. There are even apps that can solve algebra problems for you. Sounds great, right? But here's the problem: none of this helps most people actually learn how to DO algebra, especially when it's time for a test.
                    <br><br>
                    Explanations and examples are clearly not enough. Right now, students usually get practice problems on paper or a computer. If it's on paper, it's tough for a student to know how they're doing because they might not get feedback right away. They might think you did everything right, but later find out they made mistakes. That's frustrating! Imagine playing the piano but not hearing what you played until 15 minutes later. It wouldn't work well. No wonder so many people struggle with algebra!
                    <br><br>
                    Using a computer isn't much better (unless you're using Sandbox Math, of course). Most websites or apps that offer practice problems only tell you if your final answer is right or wrong. But math is more than just an answer. A lot is lost if we don't see how you got to an answer or where you got stuck along the way. Looking at your steps before you reach an answer is the best way to help you get better.
                    <br><br>
                    In essence, Sandbox Math is a valuable platform for meaningful practice by allowing you to apply the concepts that have been explained (probably more than once) to you and implement skills demonstrated in the examples you've seen. Despite its reputation, algebra is not an insurmountable subject; anyone can grasp its principles with practice. The traditional methods of practicing algebra, whether on paper or digitally, often lack timely and insightful feedback. This gap between practice and feedback can lead to frustration and hinder meaningful learning. What sets Sandbox Math apart is its focus on fostering genuine comprehension through step-by-step understanding, enabling learners to overcome misunderstandings and confidently take on any test they face.

                    August 2023 - Yes! Our website's objective is clear: assisting individuals in handling math no matter the context. However, our aim is to prevent creating a reliance on the website for algebra. Picture Sandbox Math as a practice ground, akin to a training field where you learn from your mistakes and receive guidance from a coach. This prepares you for the "game time" – like a test – where you can approach algebra problems confidently, relying on your own skills without external assistance from others or technology.
                    <br><br>
                    However, we realize there is danger when using technology to learn. Technology can sometimes do too much with all of its fancy capabilities. When technology does too much, learners don't do enough themselves, which isn't good for learning. We're aiming to find the right balance. We want the technology to be helpful, yet we also want users to be able to use their skills without relying solely on technology.
                    <br><br>
                    With Sandbox Math, we believe we've found that balance. We'll have data to support this claim soon. For now, know that we thought carefully about how the website works. If you feel like the technology isn't doing everything, that's actually intentional!

               I firmly believe that every student has the potential to comprehend algebra. The main reason some do not end up getting it is not inherent in them, but rather in the arduously inefficient learning process required to learn math. In this modern era, the practice of fundamental math skills should not entail waiting for feedback, guidance, and the chance to rectify and refine. To sustain student interest and motivation, these necessities should be available promptly. Doing so holds the key to unlocking all students' true mathematical potential.

Since 2017, he's been teaching math at the high school level across all grades and subjects. A unique aspect of his teaching is that he accompanies the same group of students throughout their entire four years of high school. This continuity has been quite rewarding. Additionally, he works in an urban environment, affording him the chance to engage with a wide variety of students. This experience has taught him a great deal about both his students and himself, as well as the essential elements of effectively teaching mathematics.</p>

                  Joe's academic background is in the field of physics, having earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in the field. He is also certified to teach high school physics, although he is not currently. One of Joe's favorite books is "QED" by Richard Feynman. In the book, Richard Feynman says, "I think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics." Joe admires this candidness shown by physicists - even the smartest ones - in acknowledging their limits by readily admitting "I don't know."

                  Joe's all about outdoor fun, whether it's going on mini-adventures with his kids, diving into open water swims, hiking, or biking. Rain or shine, any time of year, he's up for it. But here's the kicker – he pedaled his way across the entire country, from D.C. to San Francisco! Joe always has his eye on an upcoming escapade, and they all share three main ingredients: being outside, getting physical, and embracing a bit of suffering. The more of that mix, the merrier!
